			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>We're a group of 5 Belgians who've decided to enter Angelhack, one of worlds biggest hackathons. Ever. Only one of us is as Silicon Valley though. But why would 5500 miles (8800 km) hold us back in these digital times? And so we decided to set up our own little hacking space and Skype our way through the event!</p>
			<p>In 24 hours, we'll be building a prototype for a website where one can keep an inventory of his/her collections. Yes, we'll be building a collection of collections. Your place to show off your collection of rare stamps. Or meet a fellow drunk whisky-collector with whom you can share your stories. You could use it to keep track of your CD collection as well, thought you might want to start considering buying an MP3-player. But perhaps some day, you could trade that baseball card you've always wanted!</p>
